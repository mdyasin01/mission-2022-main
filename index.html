            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web
                development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web
                applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to
                which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,
                client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and
                e-commerce development..</p>
